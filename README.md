# C-Projects
This repo contains basic and small C programs I built while learning the language. Projects are intentionally small and focused — perfect for practicing fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, pointers basics, etc.)

## Purpose 🎯
This repository is maintained for:
- Practicing C programming fundamentals  
- Sharing beginner-friendly projects
