# Student Grade Calculator (C)

A simple C program that calculates the average marks of a student and assigns a grade based on the average score.

## Features
- Accepts marks for 5 subjects
- Calculates average marks
- Assigns grade based on average
- Uses separate functions for calculation and grading

## How It Works
- The user enters marks for five subjects.
- The program calculates the total and average using a function.
- Another function determines the grade based on the average.
- Final average and grade are displayed.

## Grade Criteria
- A : 90 and above  
- B : 80 – 89  
- C : 70 – 79  
- D : 60 – 69  
- F : Below 60  

## How to Run
```bash
gcc student_grade_calculator.c -o grade_calculator
./grade_calculator
```
