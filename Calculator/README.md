# Calculator

A simple console-based calculator program written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- User-friendly menu-driven interface

## How It Works
The program takes two numbers from the user and allows them to choose an arithmetic operation using a menu.  
It then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

## How to Run

```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calculator
./calculator
```

## Concepts Used
- Variables and data types
- switch statement
- User input using scanf
- Arithmetic operators
- Basic control flow

## Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand how menu-driven programs work in C and improved my confidence with conditional logic and user input handling.
