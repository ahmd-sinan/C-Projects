- Controlled probability for realistic rain gaps
- ANSI escape codes for green text color
- Adjustable animation speed
- Continuous real-time terminal output

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Randomization (`rand`, `srand`)
- Infinite loops
- Probability logic
- Terminal formatting
- Timing control using `usleep`

## How to Run
```bash
gcc matrix_rain.c -o matrix_rain
./matrix_rain
```
